A basic python app create a map with three layers, base, marker and polygon.

Using Folium and Pandas this app creates a map of the world and has added markers to 62 volcanoes in the western half of the USA, the markers are colour coded based on elevation above sea level and have a popup with the name and elevation.

The Polygon layer colour codes the population density of each country, green for under 10m, yellow for up to 100m and red for higher populations.

Layer Control is available with the icon in the top right hand corner.
